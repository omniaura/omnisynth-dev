Omnisynth Framework Documentation
=====================================


Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Omnisynth is a framework for creating and playing custom synth patches. This framework is 
a wrapper around the popoular audio programming language, Supercollider. This is made possible
through Open Sound Control communication between Python and Supercollider. The Omnisynth 
framework allows complete control with a GUI and headless commands to the audio server. Any midi 
controller should work "plug-and-play" and usb audio interfaces are also supported.
